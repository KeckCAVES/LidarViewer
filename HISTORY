LiDAR Viewer Change History
===========================

LiDAR Viewer 1.0:
- Beginning of history file

LiDAR Viewer 1.1:
- Made minor improvements to makefile
- Improved a bunch of stuff in LidarViewer, but forgot to write it
  down.

LiDAR Viewer 1.2:
- Included PrintPrimitiveFile, a utility to print a saved primitives
  file, in human-readable format.
- Fixed long-standing bug of "disappearing nodes," was due to not
  properly invalidating cached nodes under full cache conditions.
- Added workaround in sphere / cylinder extraction routine to accomodate
  the broken g++ version 4.0.1 Apple insists on shipping with Xcode on
  Mac OS X 10.5.

LiDAR Viewer 1.3:
- Added coordinate transformation to undo data offset; measurement tools
  now report positions properly in LiDAR data's native coordinate
  system.
- Bumped up Vrui requirement to version 1.0-53.
- Added support for generic comma-separated value (-csv) input file
  format to LidarPreprocessor.
- Extracted primitives can be selected (by clicking on them with a
  dragging tool).
- Selected primitives can be deleted after extraction.
- Selected primitives can be intersected to form new primitives. For
  example, intersecting two planes yields a line, intersecting three
  planes or a plane and a line yields a point, etc.
- A LidarTool can be used to map an input device (wand, mouse, etc.)
  onto the LiDAR point cloud by shooting a ray from the input device,
  and placing a virtual input device at the first intersection point.
  The virtual input device can then be combined with other tools such
  as LocatorTools for selection, DraggingTools to select primitives, or
  a ComeHitherNavigationTool to navigate to the intersection point.

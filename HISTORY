LiDAR Viewer Change History
===========================

LiDAR Viewer 1.0:
- Beginning of history file

LiDAR Viewer 1.1:
- Made minor improvements to makefile
- Improved a bunch of stuff in LidarViewer, but forgot to write it
  down.

LiDAR Viewer 1.2:
- Included PrintPrimitiveFile, a utility to print a saved primitives
  file, in human-readable format.
- Fixed long-standing bug of "disappearing nodes," was due to not
  properly invalidating cached nodes under full cache conditions.
- Added workaround in sphere / cylinder extraction routine to accomodate
  the broken g++ version 4.0.1 Apple insists on shipping with Xcode on
  Mac OS X 10.5.

LiDAR Viewer 1.3:
- Added coordinate transformation to undo data offset; measurement tools
  now report positions properly in LiDAR data's native coordinate
  system.
- Bumped up Vrui requirement to version 1.0-53.
- Added support for generic comma-separated value (-csv) input file
  format to LidarPreprocessor.
- Extracted primitives can be selected (by clicking on them with a
  dragging tool).
- Selected primitives can be deleted after extraction.
- Selected primitives can be intersected to form new primitives. For
  example, intersecting two planes yields a line, intersecting three
  planes or a plane and a line yields a point, etc.
- A LidarTool can be used to map an input device (wand, mouse, etc.)
  onto the LiDAR point cloud by shooting a ray from the input device,
  and placing a virtual input device at the first intersection point.
  The virtual input device can then be combined with other tools such
  as LocatorTools for selection, DraggingTools to select primitives, or
  a ComeHitherNavigationTool to navigate to the intersection point.

LiDAR Viewer 2.0:
- Complete re-implementation.
- Changed LiDAR data file format from .oct/.obin file pairs to
  directory-based format with Index, Point, and optional additional
  files.
- Streamlined LiDAR preprocessor's input file formats. Now supports
  several binary files, including the LAS exchange file format, and
  a generic reader for space- or comma-separated ASCII files.
- Created framework for octree-based out-of-core LiDAR data processing.
- Created LiDAR illumination program to calculate normal vectors for
  each LiDAR point based on local least-squares approximation for real-
  time illumination during viewing.
- LiDAR viewer can now do real-time point-based lighting with arbitrary
  numbers of OpenGL light sources when loading LiDAR files with pre-
  calculated point normal vectors.

LiDAR Viewer 2.1:
- Fixed bug in point-based lighting shader that for some reason only
  showed up in Mac OS X.
- Added utility to print contents of saved primitive files back to LiDAR
  Viewer distribution.

LiDAR Viewer 2.2:
- Added CalcLasRange utility to distribution; prints the bounding box of
  the point set stored in a single LAS file, and the range of intensity
  values to calculate a good color mask for LidarPreprocessor.
- Added (temporary) -lasOffset x y z command line option to
  LidarPreprocessor to subtract the given vector from all points read
  from all following LAS files before coordinates are converted to 32-
  bit IEEE floating point format. This will reduce or remove accuracy
  issues when reading LAS files in UTM coordinates.

LiDAR Viewer 2.3:
- Added preprocessor to subtract a (relatively small) set of selected
  points from a large base point set, creating a new LiDAR point set as
  a result.
- Added utility to calculate the similarity of two point subsets of the
  same base point set.
- Added an optional LidarViewer.cfg configuration file to persistently
  store LiDAR Viewer configuration options. File is located in etc
  directory underneath LiDAR Viewer's installation directory.
- Now LidarPreprocessor reads configuration settings from
  LidarViewer.cfg as well.

LiDAR Viewer 2.4:
- Incorporated most recent changes from development version:
  - Ability to combine LiDAR files in preprocessor
- Added primitive to visualize strike and dip angles of a plane.

LiDAR Viewer 2.5:
- Added ability to read gzipped ASCII input files to preprocessor.
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to 1.0-065.

LiDAR Viewer 2.6:
- Now printing strike and dip angle to console when creating a strike+
  dip indicator primitive.
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to 2.0-pre.

LiDAR Viewer 2.7:
- Some minor improvements and bug fixes.
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to 2.1-001.
- Changed build system to simplify creating binary packages.

LiDAR Viewer 2.8:
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to 2.2-001.
- Changed build system to follow Vrui's new modular build system.
- New transformation functionality in LidarPreprocessor.
- Significant code clean-up in LidarPreprocessor.
- New neighborhood-size based illumination in LidarIlluminator.
- Proper handling of offset vectors when newly-extracted primitives are
  printed.
- Added ability to load and store selector tools' states in
  configuration files.
